### 1. Positive Number Checker:
Write a Python program that asks the user to input a number and uses an `if-else` statement to check if the number is positive or not.

### 2. Multiplication Table Generator:
Write a Python program that asks the user to input a number and uses a `for` loop to print the multiplication table (Namta) of that number up to 10.
- The output should be in this format `m x n = o` for example: `2 x 3 = 6`

### 3. Odd Number Printer:
Write a Python program that uses a `while` loop to print the first 1000 odd numbers.
- Use both the increment method (Increasing the initial number by a specific value) and mod method (Check whether the number is divisible by 2)

### 4. Type Conversion:
Write a Python program that asks the user to input a number as a string (for example, '123'), converts it to an integer, and then converts it to a float. Print the value and type of the variable after each conversion.
- Use `type(var)` to show the type of the variable

### 5. Grade Assigner:
Write a Python program that asks the user to input a student's score (out of 100) and uses `if-else` statements to assign a grade to the student according to the following criteria:
- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
